# üíß Water Quality Issues Reporting System

A full-stack mobile and web solution for reporting and managing community-based water-related issues like leakages and water contamination. This project consists of:

- A **Kotlin Android app** built with **Jetpack Compose UI**
- A **React + Vite admin dashboard**
- A **shared Supabase backend** for authentication, database, and image storage

This documentation serves as a complete guide for setting up, running, and understanding the core architecture, making it easy for contributors (e.g., Jules) to get started quickly.

## üì± Mobile App ‚Äì Kotlin + Jetpack Compose

### ‚úÖ Features

- **User Authentication**
  - Supabase Auth with email/password login
  - Secure JWT session handling

- **Issue Reporting Workflow**
  - Users can report:
    - Water leakages
    - Contamination or discoloration
    - Other related issues
  - Input fields include:
    - **Issue Type**
    - **Severity Level** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
    - **Textual Description**
    - **Photo Upload** via Camera or Gallery (Camera integration uses Android's `ActivityResultContracts.TakePicture` which simplifies CameraX usage.)
    - **Real-time GPS Location** (Coordinates are fetched using Fused Location Provider and saved to the database. Embedding GPS in image EXIF metadata is a potential future enhancement.)

- **Image Capture**
  - Utilizes Android's Activity Result APIs for camera capture, which may use CameraX internally.
  - Images are saved and uploaded to Supabase Storage.

- **Geo-Tagging**
  - Uses Fused Location Provider to get device location.
  - Coordinates are saved to the Supabase Database alongside the report. (Note: Embedding coordinates directly into image EXIF metadata is not currently implemented).

- **Report Viewer**
  - Users can view the status of all their submitted reports
  - Reports show location, timestamp, and image preview

## üåê Web Admin Dashboard ‚Äì React + Vite

### ‚úÖ Features

* **Secure Admin Login** via Supabase

## üì¶ Shared Supabase Backend

* **Authentication**

  * Supabase Auth used in both mobile and web
* **Database (PostgreSQL)**

```sql
-- users
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

-- water_issues
CREATE TABLE water_issues (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  type TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  severity TEXT,
  image_url TEXT,
  latitude FLOAT,
  longitude FLOAT,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'Pending',
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

* **Storage**

  * Bucket: `water_issues_images`
  * Image access: Authenticated users upload images to a path corresponding to their user ID (e.g., `auth.uid()/image_name.ext`). This is enforced by Storage RLS policies. For images to be viewable in the app and admin panel, the `water_issues_images` bucket (or relevant paths like `/public/*` if images are stored there, though current setup is `user_id/*`) should be configured for public read access, or your application logic would need to generate signed URLs if the bucket is private. The current implementation uses public URLs.
    * **Note on Bucket Access:** For the current setup (using `publicUrl()`): In your Supabase dashboard, navigate to **Storage** > **Policies**. Select the `water_issues_images` bucket. Ensure there's a policy allowing public read access (SELECT) for all files or specifically for files under user folders if you want more granularity (e.g., `(bucket_id = 'water_issues_images') AND ((storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text)` for owner-only read, or a simpler public read policy). A common approach for public images is to have no SELECT RLS, or a policy that allows SELECT for `anon` or `authenticated` roles. The upload (INSERT) policy is already restrictive.

* **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for Database:

```sql
-- Only allow users to access their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own reports"
ON water_issues FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own reports"
ON water_issues FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev

## üîê Access Control

* **Mobile App**

  * Users must log in to submit/view reports
  * RLS restricts access to own data

* **Admin Panel**

  * Admin uses service role key to access all reports
  * Admin can modify report status and view all data

---
